# Maintrend
![Predictor build](https://github.com/Zxited/TrendlogDataApp/workflows/Predictor%20build/badge.svg?branch=master)

Maintrend is a maintenance date predictor developed as a school project for my Computer Science AP.

The predictor uses a RNN architecture with LSTM cells. The mean absolute loss for never before seen data is around 0.3 days with a maximum absolute loss at around 0.8 days.
